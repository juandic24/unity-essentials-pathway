My version of the Essentials Pathway project from Unity Learn.
I explored the Unity editor, 3D features, 2D workflow, audio, programming, publishing, and more.
In the bonus scene, I tried to create a small gallery of cool elements using free assets, where you can wander around and collect cheese while viewing the exhibits.
