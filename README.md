# Unity Essentials Pathway – My Project Version

This is my customized version of the **Unity Essentials Pathway** project from Unity Learn.

Throughout the pathway, I explored and practiced:
- Unity Editor fundamentals  
- 3D tools and components  
- 2D workflow  
- Audio implementation  
- Basic C# scripting  
- Scene design and publishing  

### 🎨 Bonus Scene – Custom Gallery
In the bonus scene, I created a small interactive gallery using free assets.  
You can walk around, explore the environment, and collect pieces of cheese placed around the exhibits. 🧀

### 📦 Free Assets Used
All assets are used according to their original licenses:

- 🎵 Music:
